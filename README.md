## Overview

**TeknoLogical** is a focused set of VCV Rack 2 modules shaped for **live minimal techno**. The goal is simple: a compact, coherent instrument that feels immediate and reliable on stage.

Each module is streamlined for **rhythmic and melodic pattern work**—sequencing, tone shaping, and controlled variation—so you can build grooves quickly and stay in the musical flow. The set is curated to work as a whole, enabling complete performances with minimal external dependencies.

> **Heads‑up:** TeknoLogical is a **purpose-built instrument**, not a general‑purpose toolkit. Some modules use fixed samples or intentionally narrowed controls to maintain a **consistent sonic character** and a fast, performance‑first workflow.

This project favors **musical constraint, immediacy, and coherence**—qualities that help keep live techno tight, expressive, and dependable. If that focus resonates with you, welcome aboard.
